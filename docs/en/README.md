!!! warning "IMPORTANT"

     In all cases where a reference to the term `[X]` is found, the participant must replace it with her seat number.

     For example, for seat number 32:
    
     * The command `ip address 10.[X].10.0/24` translates to `ip address 10.32.10.0/24`.
     * The command `router bgp 42949672[X]` translates to `router bgp 4294967232`.
     * The `LEAF[X]` device should be interpreted as `LEAF32`.
